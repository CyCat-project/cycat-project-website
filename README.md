The website is based on [Jekyll-serif](https://jekyll-serif.netlify.app/)).

This theme is open source under the MIT license. If you fork or copy this theme you must leave me as the original author in the LICENSE file (on line 3 where I am listed as the author). Really, I just don't want people copying this theme and then saying it's their theme, because I put a lot of work into my themes, thanks!
