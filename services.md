# Services

CyCAT will provide a public catalogue including an open API. The alpha version of the system is planned to be launched during the next EU ATT&CK Community workshop, on 1 June 2021.

We are currently in the initial feedback and peer review phase of the [White Paper](services/whitepaper/) and the [draft taxonomy](https://github.com/CyCat-project/cycat-taxonomy) behind the concept. This phase will end on 31 March 2021 and then we'll set out to build the aforementioned alpha version.
